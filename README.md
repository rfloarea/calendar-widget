# Calendar Widget

A simple visual calendar widget thing. Why? Because I think it's cute.

## Some reflection

This got me using `Date()` which feels very cool. I then started wondering about all the stuff we are _given_ in JS Land. Turns out I've been using these things all the time. They're called (at least by MDN) [Standard built-in object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects).

There's also this great learning resource called [JavaScript Express](https://www.javascript.express/) that seems great in general, but they also go into this whole "[standard library](https://www.javascript.express/standard_library)" business. It's geared towards people who are comfortable with programming concepts but just need to know how JS does things. The whole thing is basically a collection of examples to illustrate how things look in JS with a little bit of explanation.

This was a fun little project. There's something about working with dates that I enjoy. Dates and time.

Conditionally rendering styles is fun too! This is basic stuff, but it sparked something good in me.
